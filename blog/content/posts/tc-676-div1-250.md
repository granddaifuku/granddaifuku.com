## Overview

-   You are given an empty water tank with a capacity of \\(C\\) liters.
-   Into this tank, the water flows \\(x[i]\\) liters for \\(t[i]\\) seconds. (\\(i = 0\\) to \\(n - 1\\))
-   You can set the value of output pipe to any maximum output rate \\(R\\) (not negative value, but do not have to be an integer) in liters per second.
-   Determine the most little output rate limit \\(R\\) such that the amount of water in the tank will never exceed \\(C\\) liters.


## Explanation

-   When it comes to "Find the maximum of the minimum," we can use **Binary Search**.
-   The returning value can be double, so we apply binary search until the difference between the left and the right value becomes less than the acceptable error.


## Code

```cpp
const double EPS = 1e-9;
const Inf = 1e9;
double minOutputRate(vector<int> t, vector<int> x, int C) {
  int n = (int)t.size();
  double left = -EPS, right = Inf, mid;
  while (right - left > EPS) {
  mid = (right + left) / 2;
  double rem = 0.0;
  bool ok = true;
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	rem += (x[i] - mid) * t[i];
	rem = max(rem, (double)0);
	if (rem > C) {
	  ok = false;
	  break;
	}
  }
  if (ok)
	right = mid;
  else
	left = mid;
  }
  return right;
}
```
